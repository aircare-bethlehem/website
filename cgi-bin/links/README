This is a script built for the World Wide Web that allows users to freely
add links to your page in the sections that you specify.

File included in this script:
        1) links.html - The HTML File users see
        2) links.pl - The guts of the operations
        3) README - This file (Installation information)

To Install:
a) You must have access to execute CGI scripts on your server.
b) Put the links.pl file into your server's cgi-bin or rename it to links.cgi
	(Whichever is required on your server).
c) Put the links.html file into any dir of your choice (must be user writable)
d) Shoul dbe compatible with Version 2.1, so just modify links.pl and try 
it.. I am not sure though. :-)

LINKS.PL
This file is the file that pulls in your links.html and makes the necessary 
changes to your links.html.  It will add the url of the user's choice.  You 
must chmod this file 755 and place it in your server's cgi-bin.  You may need
to rename this to links.cgi if your server requires that sort of thing.
        EDIT VARIABLES IN THIS FILE:
                $filename = "/server/path/to/links.html" 
                        Path Location of your links.html file.
                $linksurl = "http://your.server/actual/url/of/links.html" 
                        URL Location of links.html file.
                $linkscgi = "http://your.host.xxx/cgi-bin/links.pl";
                        URL Location of links.pl.
                $linkstitle = "Free For All Link Page"
                        Title of Your Page
		$database = "/path/to/database.txt";
			Path to the database file.  This is useful if you
			want links to your page to automatically be added
			one per line to a database (for use in Random Link
			or other similar programs).  Must be chmoded to
			777.

LINKS.HTML
This file contains all of the links that users have added.  Users will be 
automatically returned to this document.  You must place this document in a 
directory with 777 file access and then chmod this file 777.  You will need to 
edit the action="" part of the <form> tag so that points to your links.pl file 
at your cgi-bin.  You will also want to change the bottom link so users can get 
back to your home page.  You can change anything above the <form> tag also... 
Just don't change the <!--XXXX--> tags unless you want to edit the script.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hopefully this is enough information to get your script up and running.  If 
you want more information please mail me.

I love to hear feedback and if anyone can improve on this it would be greatly 
appreciated.  There is no cost to use this script and you can freely modify it 
any way you wish.  All that I ask is that you possibly include my name some 
where in the file (not necessarily viewable by all users) and I would like to 
know the url of where it is being used so that I can see my script in action!

HISTORY
Version 1.0     5/14/95 - Original links.pl created
Version 2.0     5/20/95 - Patrick Kane re-wrote almost the entire script to make 
                          it work better
Version 2.1     8/05/95  - Added the count of links and date last modified to the 
                           links.html file.
                         - Changed all my <meta> tags to the appropriate comment 
                           tag <!--XXXX-->
                         - Added a datecom variable in the realization that just 
                           the 'date' command was interfering with some of the 
                           date commands located in the cgi-bin of some servers.
                         - An HTML checker to remove all HTML tags a user might 
                           try to put around their title.
                         - Added quotes around the url to make the structure more 
                           HTML compatible.
Version 2.2     7/17/96  - Fixed a bug which allowed users to post obviously
			   invalid URLS.  Now they must start with http or ftp
			   and contain something that resembles a host name.
			 - Due to a high incidence of banner postings, 
			   the software was enhanced to prevent banners 
			   and images from being posted. Main reason for the
			   update.
			 - Checks (very simply) to see if the link has already
			   been added.  If so, it doesn't allow it to be added
			   again.
			 - Allows you to auto-add the URLs to a database for
			   Random Link Generator.
			 - Changed the form so that URL field defaults to http://
			   and title field holds 80 characters max.  (These can
			   be changed, but prevent people from being stupid and
			   using up tons of lines.)
			 - I took out references to 'grep' and 'date', two unix
			   commands, which made this incompatible with other OS's.
			   Now it should work on other OS's or be a trivial hack
			   to make it work.
			 - Added a linkstitle, so your Error pages will link back
			   to your site with the site's title.
			 - Cleaned up a bit.
