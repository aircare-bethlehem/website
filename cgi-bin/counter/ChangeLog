    o can be compiled with -DALLOW_FILE_CREATION option. if compiled with
      this option, the data file will be created if it does not exist in 
      the directory defined with DataDir and the value defined with st in
      QUERY_STRING will be written to it. 
      (suggested by John Anthony Ruchak, http://www.microserve.net/~john/).

    o Advisory data file locking. Datafile will not get messed up by
      simultaneous Count.cgi processes.

    o Error messages are converted directly from string to image. No
      included GIF images are needed, will be beneficial for system with
      low memory. I borrowed the font array and some code from gd library
      (http://siva.cshl.org/gd/gd.html). Thanks to Tom Boutell
      (http://sunsite.unc.edu/boutell/index.html).

    o Authorized host names can be in configuraton file. To handle 
      "Counter Terrorism", the source code modification is not 
      necessary.

    o added flag -debug for command line testing. Therefore, compiling the
      program with -DDEBUG is not necessary anomore.

    o wigingto@umr.edu suggested to use HTTP_REFERER for checking remote
      access to the counter.

    o randerso@bite.db.uth.tmc.edu sent some code segment to account for
      port numbers at the end of a referer URL.

    o Ornamental frame with user defined color and thickness on the fly.

    o maximum number of digits can be >= 5 or <= 10 (if you use md)
      (on the fly).

    o if pad=0, the exact number of digits will be displayed without left
      padding with zeros (on the fly).

    o Any color of the digits can be made transparent on the fly.

    o Digit style can be provied on the fly.

    o sdw@iadfw.net suggested to keep configuration file, data file, digits,
      log file in separate directories. It will fix a security hole.

    o datafile can be edited.

Count 1.3
    o Hardcode the base directory of the counter data files.  This will fix
      a security hole. Thanks to carsten@group.com
