How ChatMachine works.

LOGIN Page --> WELCOME Page --> CHAT Page --> LOGOUT Page

From login page you can access chat filling a form. A nickname and a 
password are required. If nickname is new, password and other 
informations (optional fields in the form) are saved. If not, password is 
checked and informations updated.
A error page can suggest you to change your nick or retype your password 
if it is incorrect. Else, a welcome page gives you access to chat.
From chat page you can read public and private messages. You can also 
send a message to all users, or a group of them. 
With a button you can logout from chat and then logout page is showed.
Staff members can also kick off a user from the chat or forbid access to 
a nick/ip/host/domain. See Control Center.
