ChatMachine 1.1 installation. 

Few steps to install ChatMachine on your server

1.	To install ChatMachine you need a FTP account on your web server, 
a CGI directory and a good FTP Client with CHMOD feature. Using a Telnet account the installation is 
very easy and fast.

2.	Unpack ChatMachine package and delete all "dummyfile" files before starting installation.

3.	Select a CGI directory of your web server and create the chat subdirectory. 
For example : if the CGI directory is "/www/cgi-bin", create a new "/www/cgi-bin/chat" directory.

4.	Copy all files and sub-directories from ChatMachine package to the new
directory (upload them, using FTP).
Tip : Upload perl files as ASCII files (not binary).

5.	If Perl binary file ("perl") is not in "/usr/bin" directory, then change FIRST line 
(and ONLY first line) of all ChatMachine perl files (extension .pl).
For example : if Perl binary file is in "/usr/local/bin" directory, then FIRST line of perl 
scripts must be :

#!/usr/local/bin/perl

6.	Edit "include.pl" file to meet your server settings and your preference.
For quick start, edit only required settings :

	- Directory setting ($chatdir only, if you did not change directory names of ChatMachine
	      package).
	- Script Url ($scriptUrl). You must set correct URL to ChatMachine
	      scripts. <BR>For example : "http://www.myserver.com/cgi-bin/chat".
	      This setting replaces "#script_url" in templates.
	- HTML Url ($htmlUrl). You must set correct URL to ChatMachine
	      HTML resources (only images in this package) . 
	      For example : "http://www.myserver.com/cgi-bin/chat/images". 
	   This setting replaces "#html_url" in templates.

7.	Test "include.pl" file : use "perl test.pl" or "test.pl" commands. 
Without error messages, all is right. You need a telnet account.
"test.pl" script is usefull to check all settings in "include.pl" file. Use it !

8.      Set permissions : ChatMachine requires correct files - directories permissions
to work properly. Go to ChatMachine CGI directory using Telnet or a good FTP client and make these changes.
If you are using Telnet, you can run "install.sh" script instead : try "sh install.sh".

Set script file to '755'

chmod 755 login.pl
chmod 755 adm.pl
chmod 755 chat.pl

Set data directories to '777'

chmod 777 users
chmod 777 logged
chmod 777 mesg
chmod 777 laction
chmod 777 system
chmod 777 system/*

9.	Test your chat ! Call in your browser the "login.pl" script and login in 
chat. Withour error messages, all is right.
