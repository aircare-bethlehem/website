<P><B>Combating the Pollen Count</B><BR>
<Div class=smblue>(Excerpts from “The Green Guide” - May/June - article by Joanna Howard - teacher at Brown University in Rhode Island)</div>

<P>With global warming pushing up average temperatures, allergy and asthma sufferers can expect increased exposure to pollen and ragweed. This much is evident in reports from the Center for Health and Global Environment at Harvard Medical School, whose 2005 Climate Change Futures (CCF) studies examined the effects of global warming on health and environment including pollen levels.
<P>As temperatures rise, and CO2 levels with them, flowering plants are expanding their range of growth northward producing pollen earlier and longer. Plants are even making more pollen efficiently since increased CO2 also increases photosynthesis and reproductive effort.
<P>Housecleaning can reduce our exposure to airborne allergens Regular vacuuming helps to remove dust and pollen from interior surfaces and some vacuums outfitted with High Efficiency Particulate Air filters reduce the amount of particulate matter on floors and carpets as well as in the air.
<P>Air filtering or purification systems are also tools in the fight to decrease particulate matter in indoor air. Some however, are better than others and some should be avoided completely.


<P><B>Avoiding Ozone</B>

<P>Some purifiers actually worsen indoor air conditions by increasing ozone inside. While the greatest perpetrators are ozone generators, some ionic air purifiers also produce ozone, adding an electric charge to the air, but to a much lesser degree. Ionic systems, often being portable and less expensive may be tempting, but still have the potential to release ozone, and if used incorrectly, in a too small space, can build ozone to questionably unsafe levels.

<P><B>Portable Room Air Purifiers</B>

<P><center><Div class=bdblue>How about HEPAs?</div></center>

<P>HEPA filters installed through air ducts are considered the most efficient means of trapping fine particles such as pollen but these filters work through an HVAC system. However, unlike ionic purifiers or ozone generators, they do not emit ozone. William H. Anderson, M.D., spokesman for the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology says that while many allergists do recommend HEPA filters, there is no consensus that allergy or asthma symptoms will improve, but provide the most effective line of defense to indoor environmental issues.

<P><center><Div class=bdblue>Vacuums</div></center>

<P>A less expensive way to incorporate a HEPA into your life might be through your vacuum cleaner since several models are available with interior HEPA filters to help decrease particulate allergens through regular cleaning. With your floors vacuumed and your air cleaned, hopefully this allergy season will see you waking up well rested rather than “sneezy”.

<P><B>Troubled Orangutan a lesson for sick offices</B><BR>
<Div class=smblue>(Excerpts from “Boston Herald.com” by Jennifer Heldt Powell)</div>

<P><center><Div class=bdblue>Pity poor Minyak</div></center>

<P>The 23-year old orangutan was beset with breathing ailments that forced him into isolation at the Los Angeles Zoo's clinic. Sick and sad, he was put on antidepressants. The problem was finally traced to particles in the air of his home - an issue that plagues plenty of the buildings in which we live and work says the author of a new book “My Office is Killing Me”.
<P>Calling on his years of experience as a building consultant, Jeffrey C. May defines the issue and offers practical cures for both individuals and those in charge of sick buildings. “I think it's happening all the time in older and newer buildings”, he said.
<P>Up to 30 percent of new and remodeled buildings worldwide may be the subject of excessive complaints related to indoor air quality according to the World Health Organization. In his book, which will have many running for a vacuum, May says sick building symptoms range from light headaches to life-long asthma.
<P>Those who suspect they are being hurt by their work places should talk to others to see if they also have problems and then look around, May said. Problems can come from numerous sources - ranging from the heating system to the ceiling tiles to cloth chairs harboring dust mites. Those who suspect it's particles can try donning a mask. If they improve, it's time to turn to management.
<P>Minyak's story shows that there can be a happy ending. The zoo cleaned the air-handling system, sealed a fiberglass lining in the heating system and installed a new filtration system. The rare beast recovered and went on to become a father!

<P><B>Dehumidify for better IAQ</B>

<P>Air conditioning alone is not a solution for better indoor air quality. Dehumidifiers are becoming necessary to keep a tab on the humidity level for indoor spaces, writes Sanjeev Bhar in “Express Hospitality” on the <a href="<http://www.expresshospitality.com"> www.expresshospitality.com</A> website.<BR>
The principle of indoor air-conditioning is guided by factors like:
<ul type="square">
<LI>Bringing in enough air from outside the premises (outdoor air exchange).
<LI>Allowing the outdoor air in after a certain level of purification, i.e. filtration.
<LI>Controlling the airflow ,i.e. by keeping the air pressure inside the premises positive (so that when doors are opened, airflow takes place from indoors to outdoors and not the other way round).
</UL>

<P>Dehumidification is vital for conditioned spaces more than we think. In a conditioned space, temperature is kept at a definite level and a constant process of condensation takes place. Due to this, the level of moisture keeps on rising, which is not conducive for conditioned areas. The need for climate control in commercial buildings with centralized air-conditioning calls for active humidity control and hence, due importance for dehumidifiers has drawn attention over the last few years.
<P>Air-conditioning without dehumidification today, is not considered acceptable for enclosed spaces without ventilation. As a result, the demand for dehumidifiers has risen. While installing dehumidifier units, one should also consider the area of coverage of the units. It is wise not to put dehumidifiers in areas where sufficient airflow takes place. The system of dehumidification is essentially for trapped spaces.
<P>Moisture is one reason for damage caused to interiors - furniture, upholstery (carpets, curtains), etc. Also, excess of humidity in air affects health due to changes in our body mechanics leading to loss of water. This adds to the claim of this equipment, which has drawn the attention of the hospitality industry. Ventilation could be an end solution to this problem but can't be practicable due to operational constraints. This leaves dehumidifiers as the best option for a better IAQ.

<P><B>Study warns of cleaning product risks…</B><BR>
<Div class=smblue>(Excerpts from “UC Berkeley Press Release” by Liese Greensfelder, Media Relations - 22 May 2006)</div>


<P>When used indoors under certain conditions, many common household cleaners and air fresheners emit toxic pollutants at levels that may lead to health risks, according to a new study by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
Exposure levels to some of the pollutants - and to the secondary pollutants formed when some of the products mix with ozone - may exceed regulatory guidelines when a large surface is cleaned in a small room or when the products are used regularly, resulting in chronic exposure, according to the study.

<P>“We've focused a lot of effort in the last decades on controlling the big sources of air pollution and on the chemicals in consumer products that contribute to outdoor ozone formation. However, now we've learned that we need to pay attention to other aspects of pollution sources that are right under our nose”, said William Nazaroff, a UC Berkeley professor of environmental engineering and the study's lead author.
<P>Ethylene-based glycol ethers are common, water-soluble solvents used in a variety of cleaning agents, latex paints and other products. They are classified as hazardous air pollutants under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments and as toxic air contaminants by California's Air Resources Board. Their Toxicity varies with their chemical structure.
<P>Terpenes are a class of chemicals found in pine, lemon and orange oils that are used in many consumer products either as solvents or to provide a distinctive scent. Although terpenes themselves are not considered toxic, some recent studies have shown that they may react with ozone to produce a number of toxic compounds. (The primary constituent of smog, ozone enters the indoor environment from infiltration of outdoor air, but is also produced indoors by some office machines such as copiers or printers, and by some devices marketed as “air purifiers” that purposely emit ozone into the indoor environment).
<P>When the researchers tested the terpene-containing products in the presence of ozone, they found that reactions produced very small particles with properties like those found in smog and haze; other oxidation products; and formaldehyde, a respiratory irritant that is classified as a Group 1 carcinogen. (This designation by the International Agency for Cancer Research is reserved for substances for which there is sufficient evidence to conclude that they cause cancer in humans.) The amounts of terpenes that were converted into these pollutants was dependent on the amount of ozone present.
<P>The take-home message from these studies, according to Nazaroff, is that everyone - but especially cleaning professionals - should be cautious about overuse of products with high levels of ethylene-based glycol ethers and terpenes. Rooms should be ventilated during and after cleaning, some products should be used in diluted solutions as opposed to full-strength, and cleaning supplies should be promptly removed from occupied spaces once cleaning is done. Also, people should avoid the use of ozone generators or ionizing air cleaners, especially in the same space where terpene-containing cleaning products or air fresheners are being used.
<P>Dr. Nazaroff and his team have done a very thorough scientific assessment of the emissions from cleaning products and how they contribute to exposures of the users. Their results indicate that we need to look beyond the directly emitted compounds.
