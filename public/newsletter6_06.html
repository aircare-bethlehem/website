<P><B>Allentown-Bethlehem, PA - The 10th Worst City in America for Allergies!</B>

<P>Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA) pinpoints worst cities for allergy sufferers. The AAFA put seasonal allergies "on the map" today by revealing the nation's top 100 Spring Allergy Capitals<sup>TM</sup> – the most severe cities for people with allergies.



<P>"Allergy sufferers who live in a Spring Allergy Capital<sup>TM</sup> should plan ahead," says Dr. Derek Johnson, an allergist at Temple University Medical Center and a medical advisor to AAFA. "An allergy sufferer can create their own Allergy Action Plan by visiting allergyactionplan.com. After answering a few questions, you will receive a personal plan that includes helpful information on allergy triggers, prevention and treatment."

<P><B>Why is Mold a Problem Today?</B>

<P>According to statistics from the Bureau of the Census, 35% of homes in our area are damaged due to water or moisture yearly. With the wood, cellulose, and other organic materials used in buildings, this now provides a fertile platform for mold.

<P>Mold growth can start as soon as 24 hours after a water event has occurred. Mold can often be seen in the form of a discoloration or a stain. When molds are present in large quantities, called colonies, they become a health concern. Toxic molds can cause serious health effects in almost everyone. These effects may be short-term irritations to even cancer.

<P>If you think you may have mold, call us today. We have a Certified Mold Inspector and offer 5 levels of Inspection Services. <a href="http://www.aircareonline.com/pmc.html">Click here</A> for detailed information on our Mold Inspection Services.

<P><B>Scientists Conclude Black Mold Is Toxic</B>

<P>It has been thought for years that Black Mold was making people sick, but now scientists at Texas Tech prove for the first time that black mold in homes and buildings can be toxic to people. They have actually shown that once Black Mold is inhaled and gets into human beings, it causes tissue damage. Symptoms of exposure to Black Mold toxins are stomach problems, hair loss and mental confusion.



<P><B>Beware: Ozone Generators Can Be Harmful To Your Health</B>

<P>According to the EPA, "When inhaled, ozone can damage the lungs. Relatively low amounts of ozone can cause chest pain, coughing, shortness of breath and, throat irritation. It may also worsen chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma as well as compromise the ability of the body to fight respiratory infections." 

<P>Independent studies have also shown that ozone generators do not effectively destroy microbes, remove odor sources, or reduce indoor pollutants enough to provide any health benefits. 


<P><B>The Importance Of Clean Air For A Healthy Life</B>

<P>Clean air is a significant factor in creating  a healthy environment and in living a vibrant life. Many people are unaware of the effects polluted air can have on the body.

<P> According to data from the American Medical Association, a third of the country's national health bill is directly related to indoor air pollution. Deaths from asthma in children under 11 are increasing at the rate of 7 percent per year and polluted air is the cause of 97 percent of respiratory disease. There are also 40 million allergy sufferers in the U.S., many of whom believe they have hay fever.

<P>High Efficiency Air Cleaners, HEPA Filtration, UV Light, and proper humidity all play a vital role in improving indoor air quality and your health.
