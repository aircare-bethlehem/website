<BODY><h1>Press Release</h1><b>For Immediate Release - September 15, 2003</b><p><b>RGF's PHI-Cell™&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p><p>The new patent-pending PHI-Cell by RGF is the latest advancement in Photohydroionization technology. RGF has developed a proprietary broad spectrum, high efficiency UIV bulb (HE/UV) to work with RGF's hydrated quad-metallic target and RGF's PPC-UV bulb coating, also a fiber optics quartz indicator light. The target acts as a catalyst for a hydroxyl radical reaction of the broad spectrum 100-300 nm HE/UV energy with water vapor on the hydrated target. The results are hydro peroxides, super oxide ions, passive negative ions hydroxides and ozonide ions. The cell creates a very aggresive advanced oxidation atmosphere that has the ability to reduce airborne bacteria, mold and viruses up to 99% also odors and VOC's by up to 97%. A proprietary protective poly shield (RGF PPS) shields the bulb from temperature fluctuations and breakage that could release mercury, which is a problem for all UV bulbs.</p><p><img border="0" src="img/phicell.jpg" width="168" height="112"><br><br>The new proprietary, high efficiency rated bulb has an estimated life of 25,000 hours, just short of three years. RGF is providing a three-year warranty with the cell. The fiber optics indicator light can be used for remote monitoring.<br><br>RGF has successfully used its PHI-Cell in air, water, food and laundry purification systems. The Chinese Government has tested the RGF PHI-Cell and approved it for use in all government buildings and subways for SARS [virus] protection.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>For
