<B>Air Purifier eliminates harmful pollutants. </B>

<P>October 5, 2004 07:40 - TAPS™ (Total Air Purification System) uses 6-stage process to purify indoor air and eliminate allergens, bacteria, viruses, mold spores, and animal dander. It also eliminates pollen, mites, aerosols, VOCs, ozone, and CO. It employs electronic sensors to monitor air quality and automatically increase air performance to combat contamination. Warning lights signal presence of toxic chemicals and fumes before they reach 


<P>Total Air Purification System (T.A.P.S.®), patented in 1997, is the original air purification system that addresses the total environment of your home or office, not just one room. Unlike most clean air systems that are single room units, T.A.P.S.® is installed at your air handler to provide air purification throughout your home.

<P>
Unhealthy indoor air quality is comprised of three distinct elements: particulates (dust, pollen, dust mites, dander and debris); microorganisms (mold, fungi, bacteria, viruses and influenza); and gases (including smoke, carbon monoxide, carpet fumes, chemical vapors, etc.). Only the T.A.P.S.® system provides control over all these elements providing you with purified air.


<P><B>Warranty Information:</B><BR>
Lifetime warranty on casing.<BR> 
One year warranty on parts & labor. <BR>
Proper maintenance required to ensure maximum results. 


<P><B>Step 1</B><BR>The first step of the Total Air Purification System T.A.P.S. utilizes a 2" thick pleated filter. The filter provides a larger surface area to reduce particle matter including pollen, dust mites, animal dander.

<P>The first stage is a Pure-A-Tech engineered filter for supreme effectiveness on smaller size particulates, while maintaining maximum air-flow efficiency.

<P><B>Step 2</B><BR>What you don't see can hurt you! The second step of T.A.P.S.® features an Ultraviolet (UV) lamp that provides a maximum germicidal effects this eliminating microorganisms including fungus, mold spores, bacteria and viruses.

<P>The UV-C second stage is Pure-A-Tech engineered to eliminate fungi, molds, spores, bacteria, viruses, influenzas, while breaking down VOCs/Gases (Volatile Organic Compounds).

<P><B>Step 3</B><BR>This final step prevents dead bacteria from being re-circulated back into your household or office environment. A pleated activated-carbon filter gathers microscopic material already captured in the previous steps for the absorption of noxious odors, gasses.

<P>The third stage is a Pure-A-Tech engineered double activated carbon filter which catalytically converts ground level Ozone to healthy Oxygen (O2); plus it safely removes over 300 gases, such as cooking odors, chemical vapors, and formaldehyde.
