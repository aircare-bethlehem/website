      <p><font color="#660099">Stachybotrys sp. - Considerable recent media attention 
        has been focused on the fungi Stachybotrys chartum due to infant deaths 
        in Cleveland from pulmonary hemosiderosis which may be associated with 
        contamination of residences with this fungi. Stachybotrys thrives on water 
        damaged cellulose rich materials such as sheet rock, paper, ceiling tiles, 
        cellulose containing insulation backing and wallpaper. The presence of 
        this fungus in buildings is significant because of the mold&#146;s ability 
        to produce mycotoxins, which are extremely toxic, such as Satratoxin H. 
        Exposure to these toxins can occur through inhalation, ingestion or dermal 
        exposure. Symptoms include dermatitis, cough, rhinitis, nose bleeds, a 
        burning sensation in the mouth and nasal passage, cold and flu symptoms, 
        headache, general malaise, and fever. Inhalation of conidia may also induce 
        pathological changes (pneumomycotoxicoses). Satratoxin H has been reported 
        to be abortogenic in animals and in high doses or chronic low doses it 
        can be lethal. S. chartarum produces other macrocyclic and trichoverroid 
        trichothecenes and, like Memnoniella echinata, produces phenylspirodrimanes, 
        which are immunosuppressive. Stachybotrys typically appears as a sooty 
        black fungus occasionally accompanied by a thick mass of white mycelia. 
        As a general rule, air sampling for Stachybotrys yields unpredictable 
        results mainly due to the fact that this fungus is usually accompanied 
        by other fungi such as Aspergillus and Penicillium that normally are better 
        aerosolized than Stachybotrys. Bulk or surface sampling of suspect materials 
        can be analyzed in a laboratory for identification by light microscopy. 
        Cultivation - Corn meal agar, 24&deg;C.</font></p>

      <p><font color="#660099">Aspergillus sp. (Ass-pur-jill-us) <br>
        Aspergillus is a common type I &amp; III allergen. They are frequently 
        isolated from forest products, soils, grains, nuts, cotton, organic debris, 
        and water damaged building materials. Spores can also be found in moist 
        ventilation systems and house dust. There are more than 160 different 
        species of Aspergillus, sixteen of which have been documented as etiological 
        agents of human disease but rarely occur in individuals with normally 
        functioning immune systems. However, due to the substantial increase in 
        populations of individuals with HIV, chemotherapy patients and those on 
        corticosteroid treatment, contamination of building substrates with fungi, 
        particularly Aspergillus is of concern. Aspergillosis is now the second 
        most common fungal infection requiring hospitalization in the United States. 
        Many Aspergillus species produce mycotoxins that may be associated with 
        diseases in humans and other animals. Toxin production is dependent on 
        the species or strain within the species and on the food source for the 
        fungus. Some of these toxins are carcinogenic including aflatoxins and 
        ochratoxin. Aspergillus is a common cause of extrinsic asthma with symptoms 
        including edema and bronchiospasms, and chronic cases may develop pulmonary 
        emphysema. These fungi are frequently secondary opportunistic pathogens 
        in patients with bronchiectasis, carcinoma, other mycosis, sarcoid, and 
        tuberculosis. Some species can also cause onychomycosis (infection of 
        the nail). (Aw &#150; 0.71 &#150; 0.94). Culture - Potato dextrose agar 
        or Malt extract agar, 20&deg; - 25&deg;C, 7 &#150; 10 days. Speciation 
        of Aspergillus requires the culture of the fungus under different conditions 
        of media, humidity, and temperature. </font><br>

      <p><font color="#660099"><br>
        Penicillium sp. - (Aw 0.78). A wide number of organisms belong to this 
        genus. Identification to species is difficult. Often found in aerosol 
        samples. Commonly found in soil, food, cellulose, paint, grains, and compost 
        piles. It is commonly found in carpet, wallpaper, and in interior fiberglass 
        duct insulation. Although this fungus is less allergy-provoking than the 
        other molds, Penicillium is reported to be allergenic (skin) and it may 
        cause hypersensitivity pneumonitis and allergic alveolitis in susceptible 
        individuals. It can cause other infections such as keratitis, penicilliosis, 
        and otomycosis. Some species can produce mycotoxins including 1). Ochratoxin 
        which is damaging to the kidneys and liver and is also a suspected carcinogen; 
        there is also evidence that impairs the immune system. 2). Citrinin that 
        can cause renal damage, vasodilatation, and bronchial constriction. 3). 
        Gliotoxin which is an immunosuppressive toxin, and 4). Patulin that is 
        believed to cause hemorrhaging in the brain and lungs and is usually associated 
        with apple and grape spoilage. It can also cause extrinsic asthma. P. 
        camemberti has been responsible for inducing occupational allergies among 
        those who work with soft white cheeses on which the fungus grows. P. chrysogenum 
        has been found on building materials, including paints, chip boards, and 
        wallpaper. Cultivation - Potato dextrose agar or Malt extract agar, 24&deg;C.
