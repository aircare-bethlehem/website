      <p>&quot;At present, ultra-violet radiation, properly integrated with the
      heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems, shows the most promise
      as a widely applicable means of air disinfecting.&quot;</p>
      <p>UVC light properly positioned inside your HVAC system near the AC coil
      and condensation pan and drain does produce an effective sanitizing
      treatment for that immediate area. This produces an effective air
      cleansing system to reduce or eliminate airborne mold, allergens, toxins,
      cold, flu, measles or other viruses, also including toxic mold byproducts
      and odors as well as infectious bacteria.</p>
      <p>Ideal for an HVAC system located in areas of higher moisture or
      Relative Humidity. It also helps to protect you during summer AC usage
      when moisture is present inside your system.</p>
      <p>Installed UVC lighting systems start at $320.00</p>

      ventilation to combat asthma and other respiratory problems</p>
      </b>
      <p>A whole house heating, cooling, ventilation, and air purification
      system designed to produce 7 air changes of clean, fresh conditioned air
      per day.</p>
      <b><u>
      <p>Application:</p>
      </u></b>
      <p>New residential or commercial housing units up to 1,800 sq. ft. with
      the ECM high efficiency fan motor up to 3000 sq. ft. can be serviced.
      Ideal for an additional heating system with a new home addition or
      existing system retrofits.</p>
      <b><u>
      <p>Primary Benefits and Advantages:</p>
      </u></b><ol><b><u>
      </u></b>
      <li>No chimney flue required. Deliver up to 110,000 BTU’s of clean,
        fresh heated</li>
      <p>air from your hot water heater also producing domestic hot water.</p>
      <li>Fresh air ventilation at a monthly energy savings due to the
        efficiency of the</li>
      <p>lifetime HRV operating at a 90% recovery rate.</p>
      <li>A high-efficiency furnace filter removes up to 97% of airborne
        particles and</li>
      <p>allergens entering your home.</p>
      <li>Lowered equipment, installation and operating costs result in a first
        year</li>
      <p>savings of at least $1,700.00 compared to conventional combustion
      furnaces.</p>
      <li>Year-round climate control is achieved with the addition of a plenum
        mounted</li>
      <p>air conditioner. All functions; heating, cooling and ventilation are
      controlled from one thermostat. All units are AC coil ready.</p>
      <li>Easy, low-cost maintenance performed quickly and simply. The HRV coil</li>
      <p>should be cleaned twice a year and the filter changed or cleaned every
      90 days.</p>
